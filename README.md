##  Branch Overview

### ðŸ”¸ `datastructures`
This branch is a collection of core data structure implementations using Java. Code is organized into packages by structure type:

- **HashMap**: Custom implementation and key-value operations
- **LinkedList**: Singly and doubly linked list problems
- **Queue**: Circular queue, priority queue, and custom queue logic
- **Stack**: Infix/postfix conversion, balanced parentheses, etc.

Each data structure has real-world use-case problems to help understand internal working and Java-specific nuances.

### ðŸ”¸ `runtime-analysis`
Deep dive into algorithmic efficiency. This branch focuses on helping you **analyze and improve performance** through:

1. **What is Runtime Analysis?**
2. **Big-O Notation** explained in practical Java terms
3. **Time & Space Complexity** of common algorithms
4. **Best, Worst, and Average Case** analysis
5. **Optimization Guidelines** to write efficient Java code

Includes annotated code samples that demonstrate time vs memory trade-offs.

---

### ðŸ”¸ `searching`
Implement and compare classic searching techniques in Java:

- **Linear Search**: Simple and intuitive
- **Binary Search**: Fast searching with sorted data
- Includes recursive and iterative versions with complexity annotations

---

### ðŸ”¸ `sorting`
Get hands-on with Java implementations of popular sorting algorithms:

- **Bubble Sort** (basic comparison)
- **Insertion Sort** (build-as-you-go)
- **Merge Sort** (divide and conquer)
- **Quick Sort** (partition-based efficient sorting)
- **Heap Sort** (priority-based)
- **Counting Sort** (non-comparison sort for known range)
